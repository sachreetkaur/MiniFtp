# MiniFtp
Led the development of a client-server file transfer system, comprising the serverw24, mirror1, and mirror2 processes. This project facilitated seamless file requests from clients using sockets, offering functionalities such as directory listings, file information retrieval, and file retrieval based on size, extension, or creation date.
